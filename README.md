# Second Solo Project : “FOODIE”  
## Subject - 제목  
This solo project is called FOODIE in reference to the english slang “foodie”. 
A “foodie” describes a person who loves eating, discovering new tastes and new places. 
The idea behind this project was to be less generic than Instagram or Facebook by creating a space for people who enjoys sharing their new findings and who are also looking for unique and new places to eat.

## After Project - 프로젝트 후기
+ It took some time to learn and get used to the syntax and logic of React. At first, I found it rather complex to juggle between all the components and now realize the importance of well structuring the website’s skeleton before jumping into the actual building.
+ Functions I would like to add :
  + Comments : timestamp, like function;
  + Address : API when entering restaurant’s addresses;
  + Map : displaying a map when the user clicks on a post’s address;
  + Messages : chat function;
  + Friends : recommended friends;
  + Feed : recommended posts;
