# Second Solo Project : “FOODIE”

A “foodie” describes a person who loves eating, discovering new tastes and new places.

## After Project - 프로젝트 후기
+ It took some time to learn and get used to the syntax and logic of React. At first, I found it rather complex to juggle between all the components and now realize the importance of well structuring the website’s skeleton before jumping into the actual building.
+ Functions I would like to add :
  + Comments : timestamp, like function;
  + Address : API when entering restaurant’s addresses;
  + Map : displaying a map when the user clicks on a post’s address;
  + Messages : chat function;
  + Friends : recommended friends;
  + Feed : recommended posts;
